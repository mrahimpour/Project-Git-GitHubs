# Project Git & GitHubs

## Dictinory:

- Git: the magic timeline, each timeline is reffering to one project.

- GitHub: the backup of my timeline.

- Ungit: visual perception of the local repository

- 4 conceptual area: 3 in my computer and remore repository (Github)

## Where is the timeline:

- My computer:
  
  1. Developing area
  
  2. Git repository (a local repository): where you save snapshots
  
  3. Staging area (untracked files): the files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit. A channel where you organize your changes and send it to the repository by using "add" comments.

-- Developing area: file

-- Staging area: $ git add file

-- Repository: git commit -m "meaningful message"

What if we do not use -m? you can do it in the text editor which will be open

## How to initialize the git timeline

cd to the developing area, where the .md file exist. Then type "git init", we will see "Initialized empty Git repository"

## Saving a point in time

Every commit need to come with a meaningful message

A meaningful messages needs to contain:

- Why was it changed

- How this addresses the issue

- Effects due to the change

- Limitations of the changes

## Checking what is where

$ git status

## Why staging before saveing

Working on several files

## View the commit history

$ git log --oneline -> shows the IDs of the commits // **Head is the most uptodate one**

$ git log -p

It also shows all the differences between the commits

## Compare differences between the current and previous one

$ git log --patch

## Traveling in the timeline

$ git show

$ git diff

## Must-include when creating a repository

1. ReadMe.md: Detaols description of the project and tool usage

2. .gitignore: List of files that should not be added to the repository
   
   - Data files
   
   - Backup files
   
   - Intermedite files

How you can make the .gitignore file:

- Can list one by one

- Can use template (Github)

## How do we connect to the remote repository

$ git remote add

### How to remove a bridge:

$ git remote rm

## From local repository to GitHub

$ git push

**fatal**: The current branch master has no upstream branch.

To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

02 02$ git push --set-upstream Project_Git_Github master

## Bring back changes saved in the backup

$ git pull

## What if catastrophy happens !!!

- Deleting the .git file (local repository): $ rm -rf .git

- Recovering the .git file: $ git clone
